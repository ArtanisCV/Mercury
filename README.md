Directory containing several entry-level programs:

#### 1. boidae

A simple interpreter for a toy language named "boidae", including a front end and a JIT.

#### 2. pci

Codes for the book "Programming Collective Intelligence".

#### 3. cifar10

A demo which extracts "ip1" features from a learned cifar10_quick model, and then applies a linear SVM for classification. Note: The performance of "ip1" + linear SVM is almost the same with cifar10_quick (i.e., "ip1" + "ip2" + "softmax").
